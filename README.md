# Hi There!👋  

## My name is Victor Guerra

My name is Victor Guerra, I'm 18 years old and in 2023 I had my first contact with the world of programming, where I started with the C language, and today my main focus is the development of WEB applications with Java using SPRING FRAMEWORK. I really want to learn and I seek more and more knowledge every day.
